console.log('🔧 Changes Made:');
console.log('✅ Modified broadcastOrderUpdated() - Seller only broadcasts');
console.log('✅ Modified broadcastOrderCancelled() - Owner only notifications');
console.log('✅ Maintained broadcastMarketPriceChange() - Market state changes');
console.log('✅ Added detailed logging for broadcast decisions');

console.log('\n🎯 Broadcasting Rules:');
console.log('✅ Seller (OFFER) updates: Broadcasted to market:${asset}');
console.log('✅ Buyer (BID) updates: Only sent to order owner');
console.log('✅ Order cancellations: Only sent to order owner');
console.log('✅ Market price changes: Broadcasted to market:${asset}');
console.log('✅ Order owners: Always receive their own notifications');

console.log('\n📊 Event Flow:');
console.log('1. Order Update: Check if OFFER → Broadcast, BID → Owner only');
console.log('2. Order Cancel: Owner notification only');
console.log('3. Market Change: Broadcast to relevant users');
console.log('4. Order Create: General broadcast (unchanged)');

console.log('\n🧪 To test:');
console.log('1. Update a BID order - verify no broadcast to others');
console.log('2. Update an OFFER order - verify broadcast to market room');
console.log('3. Cancel any order - verify only owner gets notification');
console.log('4. Check market price changes - verify broadcast to relevant users');

console.log('\n📈 Summary of Improvements:');
console.log('🎯 Reduced Noise: Buyers updating orders no longer spam other users');
console.log('🎯 Focused Updates: Only seller updates (affecting market prices) broadcast');
console.log('🎯 Private Cancellations: Order cancellations only notify the owner');
console.log('🎯 Market Awareness: Price changes still broadcast to relevant users');
console.log('🎯 Better UX: Users only see relevant market activity');
