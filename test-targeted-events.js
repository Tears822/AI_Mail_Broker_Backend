console.log('ðŸ”§ Implementation Changes Made:');
console.log('âœ… Modified WebSocketService.broadcastOrderMatched() - targeted delivery');
console.log('âœ… Modified WebSocketService.broadcastTradeExecuted() - targeted delivery');
console.log('âœ… Modified WebSocketService.broadcastMarketUpdate() - asset-specific');
console.log('âœ… Modified WebSocketService.broadcastOrderCancelled() - targeted delivery');
console.log('âœ… Added auto-subscription to asset market rooms on connection');
console.log('âœ… Added subscribeUserToAsset() and unsubscribeUserFromAsset() methods');
console.log('âœ… Updated OrderBookService to manage asset subscriptions');

console.log('\nðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits:');
console.log('âœ… Reduced unnecessary network traffic');
console.log('âœ… Improved privacy - users only see relevant events');
console.log('âœ… Better performance - fewer event listeners');
console.log('âœ… Cleaner user experience - no irrelevant notifications');
console.log('âœ… Scalable - events scale with active traders per asset');

console.log('\nðŸ§ª To test:');
console.log('1. Create orders for different assets (WHEAT_DEC25, CORN_JAN26)');
console.log('2. Monitor WebSocket events in browser dev tools');
console.log('3. Verify events only go to relevant users');
console.log('4. Check that users not trading an asset don\'t receive its events');
