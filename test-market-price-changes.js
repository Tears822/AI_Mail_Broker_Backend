console.log('ðŸ”§ Implementation Changes Made:');
console.log('âœ… Enhanced updateOrderBookInRedis() - only broadcast on price changes');
console.log('âœ… Added changeType tracking (bidChanged, offerChanged)');
console.log('âœ… Added broadcastMarketPriceChange() method for targeted delivery');
console.log('âœ… Added market:priceChanged event handling in frontend');
console.log('âœ… Enhanced price change detection logic');
console.log('âœ… Asset-specific room targeting for price notifications');

console.log('\nðŸ“Š Price Change Detection Logic:');
console.log('âœ… Only triggers when highest bid price changes');
console.log('âœ… Only triggers when lowest offer price changes');
console.log('âœ… Tracks previous vs current prices in Redis');
console.log('âœ… Includes change type information (bidChanged, offerChanged)');
console.log('âœ… Provides detailed price change information');

console.log('\nðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits:');
console.log('âœ… Reduced noise - only relevant price changes are broadcast');
console.log('âœ… Improved performance - fewer unnecessary notifications');
console.log('âœ… Better UX - users only see price changes for their assets');
console.log('âœ… Scalable - notifications scale with active traders per asset');
console.log('âœ… Accurate - precise price change detection and reporting');

console.log('\nðŸ§ª To test:');
console.log('1. Create orders for different assets (WHEAT_DEC25, CORN_JAN26)');
console.log('2. Place orders that change highest bid or lowest offer prices');
console.log('3. Place orders that don\'t change prices (should not trigger notifications)');
console.log('4. Monitor WebSocket events in browser dev tools');
console.log('5. Verify notifications only go to users trading the affected asset');
console.log('6. Check that price change notifications show correct before/after values');
